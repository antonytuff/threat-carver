## File Structure
```
Threat Carver/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                    # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css               # External CSS styling
â”œâ”€â”€ technique_replication.py  # Technique replication module
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ run_threat_carver.bat    # Windows batch file to run the app
â”œâ”€â”€ SETUP.md                 # This setup file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ LICENSE                  # License information
```

## Usage

1. **Start the application** using one of the methods above
2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`)
3. **Explore threat intelligence** using the sidebar navigation:
   - Select different pages from the radio buttons
   - Use search functionality to find specific techniques or groups
   - Filter by tactics to narrow down results
   - Download data for offline analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Port already in use**: If port 8501 is busy, Streamlit will automatically use the next available port
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages
- **Python version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.7 or higher

### Performance Tips:
- The application caches MITRE ATT&CK data to improve performance
- First load may take a few seconds to download the latest data
- Subsequent loads will be much faster due to caching

## Support
